#  Instructions
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

# e.g. if file1.txt contained:

# 1
# 2
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:

# 2
# 3
# 4
# result = [2, 3]

# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
# First, you will need to read from the files and create a list using the lines in the files.
# This method will be really useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_readlines.asp
# Remember you can check if a value exists in a list using the in keyword. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_in.asp
# Remember you can convert a string to an int using the int() method. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp

# MAKE YOUR TO LEAVE ONLY ONE PRINT TO AVOID THE OTHER BEFORE IF NEEDED TO PAST THE TEST
# Get data from each files and convert string value without space:

f1 = open("file1.txt")
data_list1 = []

for line in f1:
  data_list1.append(int(line.strip('\n')))
  

f2 = open("file2.txt")
data_list2 = []

for line in f2:
  data_list2.append(int(line.strip('\n')))
  
  
# compare those two lists if common value
result = [number for number in data_list1 if number in data_list2]

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†
print(result)
